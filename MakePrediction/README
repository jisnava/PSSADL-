To make Predictions

In System:
1) Prepare a text file in the format as uploaded here (text_format_sample_1.txt) that consists of the Residue name(single letter code) and its three 3D coordinates. Add an 'END' at the end of the file. Rename it as text_format_sample_1.txt.
2) Install python and TensorFlow (python 3.6.9 and TensorFlow 2.6.2) or any latest versions.
3) Download the folder named 'Make_Prediction' and extract the tar file inside(the saved model).
4) Execute the python script in a terminal using the command: python3 predict.py.
5) The assignments were displayed in the terminal itself.

In Google colab:
1) Prepare a text file in the format as uploaded here (text_format_sample_1.txt) that consists of the Residue name(single letter code) and its three 3D coordinates. Add an 'END' at the end of the file.
2) Open a Google colab notebook(Google Colab, is a free cloud service provided by Google to promote machine learning and AI research)
3) Download the folder named 'Make_Prediction' and extract the tar file inside(the saved model); Upload the same in your google drive(preferably inside a new folder). Also upload the text file (renamed as text_format_sample_1.txt) containing the coordinates here. 
4) Upload and execute the notebook named 'prediction.ipynb' in colab. The paths to the files must be changed (instructions are there in the notebook).
5) The assignments were displayed below the running cell itself.
